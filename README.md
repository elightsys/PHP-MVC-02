# Welcome to the PHP MVC framework (steps 02) / Datatables with server-side (SSP)

### About this project
 This project introduce step-by-step building an own PHP MVC framework.
 That is an extremely simple and easy to understand MVC skeleton application. It's free and open-source.
 The tutorial is divided into some different parts in order to achieve a fully functional PHP CRUD application based  on Model-View-Controller archipattern.

### Goals of this project
 Teach people the basics of the Model-View-Controller architecture.

### Technologies used

- PHP7
- jQuery
- Bootsrap4

- DataTables Bootstrap 4 files
- DataTables File export
- Server-side / SSP

### Live Demo
- Coming soon!

### More details

#### DataTables Bootstrap 4
This integration is done simply by including the DataTables Bootstrap 4 files (CSS and JS) which sets the defaults needed for DataTables to be initialised as normal

#### DataTables File export
Exporting data from a table can often be a key part of a complex application. The Buttons extension for DataTables provides three plug-ins that provide overlapping functionality for data export

#### Server-side processing / SSP
There are many ways to get your data into DataTables, and if you are working with seriously large databases, you might want to consider using the server-side options that DataTables provides. With server-side processing enabled, all paging, searching, ordering actions that DataTables performs are handed off to a server where an SQL engine (or similar) can perform these actions on the large data set (after all, that's what the database engine is designed for!). As such, each draw of the table will result in a new Ajax request being made to get the required data.
